### Self Note

You've been working on this project form last 7 days and still you are around 30% left, Why ?

Here are some points I've noted,

#### 1. Poor planning

- You started with plan but in you got out of track in the process
- Your plan was not detailed enough
- You have changed your database design 2 times
- You are still not sure where to fetch the snippet data and pass down to code and note editor
- Your plan didn't time for learning you've do on the fly
- Your plan wasn't good enough to estimate proper timing

#### 2. Not testing your API

- This is your first Full stack project so this was expected but you should have tested all API points in postman
- Not completing backend before connecting it with client

#### 3. Not Documenting code

- Yes you've started adding comments about logic but it isn't enough
- You still aren't adding component wide comments like what your component should do exactly

#### 4. Managing time and motivation

- You've been working on this project for around [![wakatime](https://wakatime.com/badge/user/92c874b6-2a49-4aeb-a7d9-b52db9247eb7/project/079008b2-c124-4051-9146-9a3c4eb37c94.svg)](https://wakatime.com/badge/user/92c874b6-2a49-4aeb-a7d9-b52db9247eb7/project/079008b2-c124-4051-9146-9a3c4eb37c94)
- You should expect bit low time where things don't work as intended and you get frustrated but keep going, once it will work you'll rejoice

So, keep learning, keep practicing and keep growing.

Keep On Keeping On.
